# JoinDB
Spin up a data warehouse in under 5 minutes! JoinDB lets you easily join across all your databases and even CSVs in minutes. No complex ETLs or integration projects required.

_For [Joiner](getjoiner.com), a hosted Data Warehouse based on JoinDB, check out www.getjoiner.com._

### Setup
1. Clone the repository onto your local machine
2. Joiner requires Ruby and Docker. You will need to download those if you don't have them already.
#### Start the server
3. After downloading Docker, pull the Docker image with `docker pull mjirv/joiner:master`
4. Run the docker image with `docker run -p 5432:5432 --name joiner mjirv/joiner:master`
5. Make sure you open port 5432 if you want other computers to be able to connect to your JoinDB
#### Connect to it
6. Run `ruby install.rb` to create your login and see connection details
7. Run `ruby joindb_client.rb` and follow the prompts on the screen to set up your analytics database and add connections to it
8. Query via your favorite PostgreSQL client like any other database!

### Notes
- Joiner currently only supports PostgreSQL and MySQL connections plus CSV imports. I'm adding more soon!
- Best practice is to connect to your other DBs using a read-only user so that your JoinDB can't change your production DBs
